1967-1977,period,winter,First AI winter,"Researchers begin to realize that achieving AI is going to be much harder than was supposed a decade earlier, but a combination of hubris and disingenuousness leads many university and think-tank researchers to accept funding with promises of deliverables that they should known they cannot fulfill. By the mid-1960s neither useful natural language translation systems nor autonomous tanks had been created, and a dramatic backlash set in. The agencies funding AI research, such as the British government, DARPA and the National Research Council (NRC) become frustrated with the lack of progress and eventually cut off almost all funding for undirected AI research. Note: The dates of this first AI winter vary a little according to different sources. "
